Developed a Streamlit-based predictive maintenance dashboard that analyzes sensor data from various industrial machines (Motors, Pumps, Compressors) to predict Remaining Useful Life (RUL), detect anomalies, and classify maintenance needs. Integrated machine learning models (RandomForest, XGBoost, KMeans) for accurate predictions. Enhanced user experience with an interactive UI for inputting machine-specific sensor data and visualizing insights.
